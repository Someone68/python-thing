# READ BEFORE RUNNING THE GAME
cool game: requires python 3<br><br>
**install required libraries** with `pip install -r requirements.txt` AFTER you are in the project directory.<br>
**if pip is not in PATH**, then run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` or `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
**if you are on windows:** you may also need to install windows-curses. run `pip install windows-curses` or `python -m pip install windows-curses` or `py -m pip install windows-curses`, depending on your python installation.<br><br>
**TO RUN THE GAME:** Once you are in the project directory, run `python main.py`, or `py main.py` or just open `main.py` if it automatically runs with python<br><br>
*to enable devtools*: please do this after you have finished the game normally. type `devtools` when your stats are shown in each cycle and then press enter.<br>
have fun
